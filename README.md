# mome-map

> **This project has moved to [ashron24/ome-map](https://github.com/ashron24/ome-map)** — live at https://ashron24.github.io/ome-map/. This repository is archived and no longer updated.

An open-source rebuild of the legacy **CAU Outreach Map** (NYC Mayor's Community Affairs Unit, 2015–2018) using only **public** data and **open-source** tools — no authentication, no internal-only layers.

**Live:** https://ashron24.github.io/mome-map/

The original map ran on Leaflet + CartoDB. CartoDB has been sunset and the original layers (clergy contacts, internal program targeting, staff geographies) were intentionally never republished. This project recreates the **public-data subset** of that map on a modern stack so the spatial-analysis value of the original is preserved without exposing anything that was private.

## What's included

| Panel section | Layers | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Districts** (14) | Community Board · City Council · NY State Senate · NY State Assembly · US Congress · Police Precinct · School District · Sanitation District · Fire Battalion · Health Center District · BIDs · Historic District · Zipcode · Neighborhood (NTA) | [`MODA-NYC/nyc-geography-crosswalks`](https://github.com/MODA-NYC/nyc-geography-crosswalks) (fallback: NYC Planning ArcGIS); DSNY districts from NYC Open Data |
| **Facilities & Infrastructure** (14) | Public Schools (K-12) · Colleges & Universities · Day Care & Pre-K · Libraries · Hospitals & Clinics · Cultural Institutions · Parks · Community Gardens · Bike Routes · Subways (stations + lines) · Bus Routes · Bus Shelters · LinkNYC Kiosks · Public Restrooms | NYC DCP FacDB, NYC Open Data |
| **Outreach & Services** (4) | DYCD Program Sites · SBS Program Sites · NYC Service CBOs · Soup Kitchens & Food Pantries | NYC Open Data, NYC DCP FacDB |
| **Agency Enforcement** (3 heatmaps) | HPD Open Violations · DOB Active Safety Violations · DEP ECB Open Violations | NYC Open Data, geocoded via MapPLUTO BBL centroids |
| **Demographics — choropleths** (7) | % Hispanic · % White (non-Hispanic) · % Black (non-Hispanic) · % Asian (non-Hispanic) · % Foreign-Born · % Non-Citizen · Median HH Income | US Census Bureau API, ACS 5-Year (2019–2023), census tracts |
| **Demographics — ethnicity** (15 graduated symbols) | *Hispanic / Latino:* Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican, Central American, South American, Colombian, Ecuadorian · *Asian:* Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Asian Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani · *Arab / Turkish / Albanian:* Arab, Turkish, Albanian | ACS tables B03001, B02015, B04006 via the Census Bureau API |
| **Basemap** (4) | Light (NYC Labels Only, default) · NYC Basemap (OTI v3) · OSM Streets · Satellite | NYC OTI / Esri vector tiles, OpenFreeMap, OpenStreetMap, Esri |

Other features:

- **Layer menu** — click the **OME MAP** title to roll the menu up to a title bar and click again to roll it back down. On phones (≤ 640 px wide) the menu starts rolled up.
- **Point icons** — Libraries, Public Schools, Colleges & Universities and LinkNYC Kiosks use icons instead of dots; school and college icons are recolored per category (e.g. Public vs. Charter School). All icons and dots keep growing as you zoom in, and dense layers (schools, LinkNYC) start extra small when zoomed out.
- **Polygon labels follow the view** — each district and neighborhood is labelled once, and when only part of an area is on screen its label moves into the visible part if it fits there (see `src/map/dynamicLabels.ts`).
- **District popups** show elected officials for council / state / congressional districts, and Community Board contact info, meeting details and a website link (from `scripts/data/officials.csv` plus NYC Open Data).
- **Search** (top right) matches neighborhoods, boroughs and ZIP codes locally; full address search uses NYC Geoclient when a key is configured.
- **Permalinks** — the URL hash encodes the view (center, zoom, basemap, and every active layer), so any map state can be shared by copying the URL. Layers turned on by a link show as checked in the menu. Without a hash, the map opens on all five boroughs (`NYC_CENTER` / `NYC_ZOOM` in `src/main.ts`).
- **Legends** — category legends (with the tinted icon or color dot) under active POI layers, and a legend for the active choropleth.

## What's intentionally NOT included

Per the project scope, none of the following are in this repo or in any data file it ships:

- **Religious organization point layers** (the original "clergy" contact database)
- **CAU Borough Director Turfs** (internal staff geography)
- **Internal program targeting layers** — PEU targets, Benefits Access hot spots, IDNYC outreach events, OCDV / DCA outreach, SCRIE targets, paid-sick walks, nail-salon targets, mayoral / FLONYC events
- Anything requiring credentialed data sources

If you need the private-layer functionality from the legacy map, that work belongs in a separate, access-controlled deployment — not this public repo.

## Stack

- **MapLibre GL JS 6** — vector/raster renderer (open-source fork of Mapbox GL). MapLibre 6 is ESM-only and finds its web worker relative to its own module, which Vite relocates when bundling; `src/main.ts` therefore calls `setWorkerUrl()` with the worker file Vite emits. Without it the map renders blank (`Worker failed to load` in the console).
- **Vite + TypeScript** — vanilla, no framework
- **Static deploy** to GitHub Pages
- **Build-time ETL** in TypeScript fetches data from NYC Open Data and the Census Bureau and writes static GeoJSON/JSON to `public/data/` (gitignored — reproducible from the ETL)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashron24/mome-map.git
cd mome-map
npm install

# Census Bureau API key (free) — required for the Demographics layers
# https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
export CENSUS_API_KEY=<your-key>

# Optional: NYC Geoclient key for full address search (https://api-portal.nyc.gov/)
# Put it in .env.local so Vite picks it up:
#   VITE_GEOCLIENT_KEY=<your-key>

# Fetch all data (see "Data refresh" below)
npm run data:all

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173/
```

If a layer looks empty or a popup is missing details locally, your `public/data/` is probably stale or incomplete — re-run the relevant `npm run data:*` command (`data:census` needs `CENSUS_API_KEY` set and exits with an error without it).

The boundaries ETL (`data:boundaries`) reads from a local checkout of `nyc-geography-crosswalks` at `./nyc-geography-crosswalks/outputs/` (or `$CROSSWALKS_OUTPUTS`). If you don't have one, use `npm run data:all:direct`, which pulls boundaries from NYC Planning's ArcGIS REST API instead.

## Data refresh

Each ETL is idempotent — running it overwrites the corresponding files under `public/data/`.

| Command | What it writes |
|---|---|
| `npm run data:boundaries` | `boundaries/{id}.geojson`, split from `nyc-geography-crosswalks`' `all_boundaries.geojson` |
| `npm run data:boundaries:direct` | Same, fetched from NYC Planning ArcGIS (no crosswalks repo needed) |
| `npm run data:dsny` | `boundaries/dsny.geojson` — Sanitation Districts (NYC Open Data `i6mn-amj2`) |
| `npm run data:pois` | `pois/*.geojson` — schools, day care, libraries, hospitals, cultural, parks, gardens, bike routes, subways, buses, LinkNYC, restrooms |
| `npm run data:dycd` | `pois/dycd-sites.geojson` (`ebkm-iyma`) |
| `npm run data:sbs` | `pois/sbs-sites.geojson` (`6smc-7mk6`) |
| `npm run data:cbos` | `pois/cbo-sites.geojson` (`i4kb-6ab6`) |
| `npm run data:food` | `pois/food-sites.geojson` (FacDB `ji82-xba5`) |
| `npm run data:universities` | `pois/universities.geojson` (FacDB `ji82-xba5`) |
| `npm run data:heatmaps` | `heatmaps/*.geojson` — HPD, DOB, DEP ECB violations, geocoded with MapPLUTO |
| `npm run data:census` | `census/` — ACS tract choropleth values and tract-centroid ethnicity counts (needs `CENSUS_API_KEY`) |
| `npm run data:cb-websites` | `cd-websites.json` — Community Board website lookup (`ruf7-3wgc`) |
| `npm run data:officials` | `district-officials.json` — built from `scripts/data/officials.csv` |
| `npm run data:all` | All of the above, sequentially (`data:all:direct` uses the ArcGIS boundaries path) |

To move to a newer ACS release, bump `ACS_YEAR` in `scripts/fetch_census.ts`.

Caveats worth knowing:

- The "Public Schools" layer is FacDB's `SCHOOLS (K-12)` facgroup, which includes private K-12 schools alongside public DOE schools. The original map filtered more aggressively; this version is broader.
- The legacy map's **Median Income-to-Rent ratio** choropleth is not yet reproduced (it would come from ACS B25071).
- Elected officials and CB info come from a hand-maintained CSV (`scripts/data/officials.csv`) — update it after elections or board changes.

## Customizing

### Point icons

Point layers are defined in `POIS` in `src/map/pois.ts`. To draw a layer with an icon instead of a dot:

1. Put a PNG in `public/icons/` (a single-color shape on a transparent background works best; any resolution — icons are drawn at 16 CSS px at zoom ~13 and scale with zoom).
2. On the layer's definition set `icon: "icons/<file>.png"`. The same image is used as the layer's swatch in the menu.
3. Optional: `iconTint: { prop, colors, fallback }` fills the icon's shape with a color per category (the same `[value, color]` pairs used for the layer's legend), so one PNG serves every category.
4. Optional: `iconSize: SMALL_START_ICON_SIZE` for dense layers, so icons start small when zoomed out.

Icon and dot sizes per zoom level are the `ICON_SIZE`, `SMALL_START_ICON_SIZE`, `DOT_RADIUS` and `HOLLOW_DOT_RADIUS` constants near the top of `pois.ts`.

### Title

The **OME MAP** title is an SVG (`public/ome-map-title.svg`) exported from Canva in the Pintazo typeface, which isn't licensed for web embedding as a font. To change it, export a new SVG and replace the file. The previous text title (Union Gothic, `public/fonts/union_gothic-variable.ttf`) is still styled by `#panel h1` in `src/style.css`; to switch back, set the title's text in `mountLayerPanel` (`src/ui/layerPanel.ts`) instead of inserting the image.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and publishes the site on every push to `main`. It clones `nyc-geography-crosswalks` (and downloads its latest `all_boundaries.geojson` release asset), runs every ETL — each one is allowed to fail without blocking the deploy — then `vite build`, then deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

Setup:

1. In **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add a repository secret `CENSUS_API_KEY`. Without it the census step is skipped and the Demographics panel has no data.
2. Optional: add a repository secret `VITE_GEOCLIENT_KEY` to enable full address search. Without it, search still matches boroughs, neighborhoods and ZIP codes.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source: GitHub Actions**.
4. Optional: set the repo variable `VITE_BASE_PATH=/` if deploying to a user/org site or custom domain at root (defaults to `/<repo>/`).

Open-data source URLs are stable but can move — if an ETL starts failing, check that the dataset still exists at the same Socrata 4×4 ID. Because ETL failures don't fail the build, check the workflow logs for `[deploy] … skipped` lines if a layer goes blank.
